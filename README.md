The Sparks Foundation Repository contains the tasks I completed while working as a Data Science & Analytics Intern for the Sparks Foundation.

* Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
* Internship Duration - 1 month (1 June 2022 - 30 June 2022)
* Internship Type - Work from Home

The internship includes several tasks which are as follows:



## Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML
- Q.1.1- Predict the percentage of an student based on the number of study hours. 
- Q.1.2 - What will be the predicted score if the student studies 9.25hrs/day?
- This is a simple linear regression task as it involves only 2 variables. I have used Python for task.
